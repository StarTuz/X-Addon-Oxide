# Attributions and Heritage

X-Addon-Oxide is a next-generation evolution of the original concepts and code found in the **xaddonmanager** project.

## Original Authorship

We wish to formally acknowledge and thank **Austin Goudge**, the original author of `xaddonmanager`, for his pioneering work in creating a structured, non-destructive addon management system for X-Plane.

The core philosophy of safety-first, non-destructive toggling that defines X-Addon-Oxide today has its roots in Austin's original vision.

## Evolution

While X-Addon-Oxide has since been completely rebuilt in Rust with a modern GPU-accelerated interface, AI-driven diagnostics (BitNet), and an interactive world map, it remains spiritually and technically a successor to the work started by Austin.

## Licensing

All inherited code and concepts remain licensed under the **MIT License**, consistent with the original project's terms.
