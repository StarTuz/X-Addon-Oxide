## Installation

### Download Installers (Recommended)

Grab the latest professional installers from the [Releases](https://github.com/StarTuz/X-Addon-Oxide/releases) page:

- **Windows**: `.exe` (NSIS Installer)
- **macOS**: `.dmg` (Disk Image)
- **Linux**: `.tar.gz` (Binary tarball)

### Building from Source

#### Prerequisites

You will need the **Rust** toolchain installed ([rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/)).

#### System Dependencies (Linux)

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libasound2-dev libfontconfig1-dev libwayland-dev libx11-dev libxkbcommon-dev libdbus-1-dev
```

#### Steps

1. **Clone & Build:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/StarTuz/X-Addon-Oxide.git
   cd X-Addon-Oxide
   cargo build --release
   ```

2. **Run:**

   ```bash
   cargo run --release -p x-adox-gui
   ```

#### Building AppImage (Linux)

For a portable Linux distribution, you can build an AppImage using Docker to ensure compatibility across distributions (like Arch or Ubuntu):

```bash
chmod +x scripts/build_appimage.sh
./scripts/build_appimage.sh
```

This will create `X-Addon-Oxide-x86_64.AppImage` in the root directory.
